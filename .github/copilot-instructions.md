# Copilot Instructions for Food Diary Frontend

## Project Overview

This is a SolidJS frontend application for a food diary/nutrition tracking web app. The application uses TypeScript, Vite for bundling, and TailwindCSS for styling.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: SolidJS (not React - SolidJS has different patterns and primitives)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with the @tailwindcss/forms plugin
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Routing**: @solidjs/router
- **Authentication**: Auth0 (@auth0/auth0-spa-js)

## Project Structure

## Coding Conventions

### SolidJS Patterns

- Use SolidJS reactive primitives: `createSignal`, `createResource`, `createEffect`, `createMemo`
- Use `Show` component for conditional rendering instead of ternary operators
- Components are typed using `Component` from solid-js
- JSX uses `class` attribute (not `className` as in React)

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define types for API responses and data structures
- Use type imports: `import type { Component } from "solid-js"`
- Prefer explicit typing over inference for function parameters and return types

### Styling

- Use TailwindCSS utility classes directly in JSX
- Avoid custom CSS when possible; use Tailwind's utility-first approach
- Use the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin for form styling

### API Layer

- This application uses a hasura/graphql-engine backend
- GraphQL queries and mutations are defined as template strings in `Api.ts`
- API functions accept an `accessToken` as the first parameter
- Use snake_case for GraphQL field names, camelCase for TypeScript properties
- Use the `objectToSnakeCaseKeys` helper when sending data to the API

### Testing

- Use Vitest for testing
- Test files are named `*.test.ts` and placed alongside source files
- Use `describe`, `it`, and `expect` from Vitest
- Tests run with `npm test`
- Tests expect to be run in the America/Los_Angeles timezone. set TZ=America/Los_Angeles before running
- **NEVER mock `fetch` directly** - always use Mock Service Worker (MSW) instead
- MSW is configured in `src/test-setup.ts` with a `server` export
- Import `server` from `./test-setup` and use `server.use()` to mock HTTP requests
- Use `http.post()` or `http.get()` from `msw` to define request handlers
- Example:

  ```typescript
  import { http, HttpResponse } from "msw";
  import { server } from "./test-setup";

  server.use(
    http.post("/api/v1/graphql", () => {
      return HttpResponse.json({
        data: {
          /* mock data */
        },
      });
    }),
  );
  ```

### Automated Checks

This project uses several automated checks tha must pass before any pull request is merged.

- tsc checks for any errors or warnings in typescript types
- prettier checks for consistent formatting
- the unit tests must pass
- the acceptance tests must pass

please run all of these checks, and make sure they pass, before committing changes.

## Common Commands

- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` or `npm start` - Start development server on port 3000 (both commands are equivalent)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests with Vitest

## Development Notes

- The app uses Auth0 for authentication; users must be logged in to access features
- API calls go through `/api` proxy which forwards to the backend GraphQL endpoint
- Date handling uses `date-fns` library
- CSV import/export functionality is available for diary entries
